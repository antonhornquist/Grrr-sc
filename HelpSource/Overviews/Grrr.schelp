categories:: External Control

section::Introduction

Grrr provides high level UI abstractions for grid based controllers. The library is inspired by early mono-bright monome devices (link::http://www.monome.org::): a bunch of buttons with lights arranged in a grid, the visual feedback being decoupled from the buttons.

Grrr reuses principles of the standard SuperCollider GUI class library (see link::Guides/GUI-Introduction::).

subsection::Hello World
code::
a=GRScreenGrid.new; // creates a virtual grid which shows up in a separate window
b=GRButton(a, 0@0); // places a 1x1 button at top left key
b.action = { |view, value| (value.if("Hello", "Goodbye") + "World").postln }; // sets an action to be triggered when the button is pressed

// pressing the top left grid button of the virtual grid will change led state and output to the Post Window
::

subsection::An example with sound
code::
s.boot;
a=GRScreenGrid.new; // creates a virtual grid
b=GRButton(a, 0@0); // places a 1x1 button at top left key
b.action = { |view, value| if (value) { c = {SinOsc.ar}.play } { c.release } }; // sets an action to be triggered when the button is pressed

// pressing the top left grid button of the virtual grid will change led state and audition a sine oscillator

	## link::Classes/GRKeyboard:: - Keyboard representation
	## link::Classes/GRContainerView:: - Abstract class for views that may contain other views.
		tree::
		## link::Classes/GRTopView:: - This is the topmost view in a view tree and typically the view to which controllers attach. The view cannot be added as a child to any other view.
		## link::Classes/GRMultiButtonView:: - A grid of buttons of the same size.
			tree::
			## link::Classes/GRStepView:: - A grid of buttons of the same size referred to by index. One of the steps may be indicated as the playhead position. Suitable for step sequencing.
			::
		## link::Classes/GRMultiToggleView:: - An array of vertical or horizontal toggles of the same size.
		::
	::
link::Classes/GRController:: - Abstract superclass. Represents a device that may attach to and control part of or an entire GRView.
	tree::
	## link::Classes/GRMonome:: - Monome controller (defaults to the bounds of an horizontally oriented monome 128).
		tree::
		## link::Classes/GRMonome64:: - 8x8 monome.
		## link::Classes/GRVMonome128:: - 8x16 monome.
		## link::Classes/GRHMonome128:: - 16x8 monome.
		## link::Classes/GRMonome256:: - 16x16 monome.
		::
	## link::Classes/GRScreenGrid:: - An on-screen controller of user definable size. Button events may be triggered with mouse and keyboard.
