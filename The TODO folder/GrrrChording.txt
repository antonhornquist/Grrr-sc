getViewButtonChord

A view's "view button chord" pertains to the last set of buttons getting simultaneously held upon a view button press event. 

The view button chord is retained as long as no new view buttons are pressed - defining a new chord - and as long as the last pressed view button is of the view is not yet released. When the last button held of a view is released the viewButtonChordReleasedAction is triggered. 

Examples:
a=GRScreenGrid.new;
b=GRView.new;
b.viewButtonStateChangedAction = {
  If pressed
    The view has a new chord: getViewButtonChord
  Else
    Current chord: getViewButtonChord
  End
flashPoints(chord)
}
b.viewButtonChordReleasedAction = { |chord|
Released chord + chord
}
